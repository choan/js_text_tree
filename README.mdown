# TextTree

TextTree is a simple JavaScript library designed to simplify generation of tree-like structures taking strings as input.

Node nesting is expressed by indentation (only spaces, no tabs allowed) of lines. Lines are converted to child nodes of previous line which is indented at lower level.

## Example usage

Use `TextTree.parseInput` to create the tree from a string:

    var tree = TextTree.parseInput('a\n  b\n    c\nd\n  e');
    // returns a string representation of the tree, which,
    // in this case, should be **identical** to the given input
    tree.dump();

Yeah, that's not very useful. But you can pass a transformer option as a second argument, which will be used to create node-like objects according to your necessities.

The transformes callback **must** accept three arguments: text, tabs and line number. Its return value must be `null` or a node-like object able to handle, at least, the `dump` and `dumpChildren` methods. Of course, you can inherit from `TextTree.Node` if needed/wanted. If `null` is returned, the line is not pushed to the tree.

    var F = function() {};
    F.prototype = TextTree.Node.prototype;
    var MyNodeType = function() {
      TextTree.Node.apply(this, arguments);
    };
    MyNodeType.prototype = new F();
    MyNodeType.prototype.dump = function(opts) {
      return this.text + ' { indent: ' + this.tabs + ', lineNumber: ' + this.lineNumber + ' }\n' + this.dumpChildren(opts);
    };
    var tree = TextTree.parseInput('a\n  b\nc\n  # a comment\n  d', function(text, tabs, line) {
      if ('#' == text.charAt(0)) return null;
      return new MyNodeType(text, tabs, line);
    });
    tree.dump();

Output from the previous script:

    a { indent: 0, lineNumber: 1 }
    b { indent: 1, lineNumber: 2 }
    c { indent: 0, lineNumber: 3 }
    d { indent: 1, lineNumber: 5 }

Still not very useful. But, hey, you can create useful node types. You can use a transformer callback that uses one or another node type based on patterns of the input text. Heard about Sass? Haml? Cucumber? You may use TextTree as a base library to parse any text format that relies on indentation to express parent-children relationship.


## QOWA (Questions Oscar will ask)

### How much indentation?

You can use any number of spaces as the base indentation. Once a line in the input appears indented, the number of spaces at its start will be taken as the indentation unit. Incorrect indents will throw exceptions. TextTree is not mindundi friendly.

### Building

Run `rake dist` to build the full script (on "dist/text_tree.js").
